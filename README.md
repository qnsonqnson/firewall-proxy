# Precautions
- The project remarks "Need a domain" **need you have a domain** to build the service   
 It's necessary, **If you do not have, please buy one**    
- If you choose **"Need a domain"** solution, you need a little knowledge about     
**"How to set a record on your Nameservice Provider to Point your Domain to your Server IP address"**   
All the servive build in this premise,**Because it's so easy to learn, I won't introduce again in the Tutor**
